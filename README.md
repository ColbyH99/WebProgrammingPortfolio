# WebProgrammingPortfolio
Here is a collection of my projects I built during my semester taking Web Programming. Assignments include work done with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and several formats and frameworks.

Asg #1: The homepage I created in Web Programming. We were in charge of styling the website, but the HTML had to follow specific guidelines (include 1 picture, display our personal interests etc.).

Asg #2: This assignment involved PHP for the first time. We explored printing in PHP, and introduced the use of forms for the first time. 

Asg #3: A simple assignment in which we had to redo our first homepage using PHP instead. Intended to get us used to printing in PHP and calling functions.

Asg #4: Here we had to create a webpage that displayed our personal interests, using Bootstrap to format the content.

Asg #5: A PHP file that creates a blog. You can add and remove blog entries using button forms and text forms. A great assignment that utilizes many functions. 

Asg #7: In assignment 7 we created a carousel formatting of several images, meaning you click right or left to cycle through the provided images.
