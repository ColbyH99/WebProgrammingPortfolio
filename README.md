# WebProgrammingPortfolio
Here is a collection of my projects I built during my semester taking Web Programming. Assignments include work done with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and several frameworks.

Asg #1: My first website I created in Web Programming. We were in charge of styling the website, but the HTML had to follow specific guidelines (include 1 picture, display our personal interests etc.).
