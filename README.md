# WebProgrammingPortfolio
Here is a collection of my projects I built during my semester taking Web Programming. Assignments include work done with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and several frameworks.

Asg #1: The homepage I created in Web Programming. We were in charge of styling the website, but the HTML had to follow specific guidelines (include 1 picture, display our personal interests etc.).

Asg #2: This assignment involved PHP for the first time. We explored printing in PHP, and introduced the use of forms for the first time. 

Asg #3: A simple assignment in which we had to redo our first homepage using PHP instead. Intended to get us used to printing in PHP and calling functions.
