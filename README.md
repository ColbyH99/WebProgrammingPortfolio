# WebProgrammingPortfolio
Here is a collection of my projects I built during my semester taking Web Programming. Assignments include work done with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and several formats and frameworks.

Asg #1: The homepage I created in Web Programming. We were in charge of styling the website, but the HTML had to follow specific guidelines (include 1 picture, display our personal interests etc.).

Asg #2: This assignment involved PHP for the first time. We explored printing in PHP, and introduced the use of forms for the first time. 

Asg #3: A simple assignment in which we had to redo our first homepage using PHP instead. Intended to get us used to printing in PHP and calling functions.

Asg #4: Here we had to create a webpage that displayed our personal interests, using Bootstrap to format the content.

Asg #5: A PHP file that creates a blog. You can add and remove blog entries using button forms and text forms. A great assignment that utilizes many functions. 

Asg #7: In assignment 7 we created a carousel formatting of several images, meaning you click right or left to cycle through the provided images. 

Asg #8: Our first assignment utilizing JavaScript. Validates whether name, phone and email addresses exist. Also does basic regex checks against the phone and email. 

Asg #9: An implementation of a datatable via jQuery that displays different showings of movies around Austin. 

Asg #10: In this assignment, we first make the user login on one webpage, then they can select a song that they want to purchase on another and check out on the final webpage. Here, we learned about sessions to keep track of whether the user is already logged in or not. 

Asg #11: Essentially the same assignment as asg #10, except we used SQL queries to ensure the user enters the correct username and password and also retrieve the songs from a mySQL database. 

Asg #12: We utilized the google apis to display a pin on google maps of a location of our choice. 

Asg #13:
